<p>Thank you for reaching out and wanting to have a chat with me.  Usually this page would divert you to a page showing my calendar availability and allow you to schedule some one to one time with me, to either have a chat about technology, career advice, or just meet someone new.  However
I am currently taking a "coffee break" and focussing on some personal development and downtime at the moment.</p> 

<p>I hope to re-open the opportunity to have a one to one virtual coffee with me after the summer break. </p>

<p>In the meantime, please feel free to check out my <a href="http://www.techielass.com" target="_blank">blog</a> or my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/techielass" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>. </p>

<p>- Thanks, Sarah</p>

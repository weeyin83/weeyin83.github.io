## Feedback

When I deliver a talk your feedback is important to me, it helps me to improve upon each delivery and better tailor my talks to the audience.   So with that in mind I am using a cloud solution that one of my fellow Microsoft colleagues designed.  Using [Ben Coleman's](http://benco.io/) Azure Container Instances solution you can provide feedback on my talks.  The feedback is only available on the day of the talk.

To provide feedback for one of my talks, click on the image below:
